<h1><b> it was a good morning until </b></h/>
<p>
It was a <i> good morning </i>,until i pushed snooze<br/>
I was late for work ,and coudnt find my shoes -<br/>
my car was out of gas so ,i called a cab .<br/>
The whole day, was a total drab.<br/>
I arrived at work ,in my bare feet .<br/>
my computer had shut down , and i lost all my files . <br/> 
my boss was full of anger , instead of perky smiles.<br/>
he was going to five me, but he said he would give me another chance .<br/>
I praised the lord right then and there,and did a little dance .<br/>
listen to me closely ,this is my final rhyme.<br/>
If you have a job, always be on time.<br/>
